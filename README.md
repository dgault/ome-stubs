# OME stubs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ome/ome-stubs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ome/ome-stubs)

Purpose
-------

Components that are stubs of other external projects.  They provide support
for compiling against such projects regardless of the availability of the
external projects' source code.

 * run the unit tests (```ant test```) and correct any failures
 * test at least one file in each affected format, using the ```showinf```
